## Brief information about the supplied data 

Here we provide the relevant data used in our analysis. Note that we have collected all the data from the website https://covidtracking.com. Thereafter we correct for the gliches in the data using the methods described in the **Data collection** section of the preprint. We bin the data using binning method described in **Some data analyses details and plots** section. Here we provide the unbinned data in the input_data folder. 



## Brief description of the code

We also provide the code to obtain the best fit to the curve given a particular function. Here we supply the example of Tangent function. But the code can be used to fit other functional forms as well.
