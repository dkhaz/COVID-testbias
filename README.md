# COVID-testbias
The actual number of COVID-19 infections is a key to understanding the transmis- sion of the disease. It is also a critical factor for policy-making during the pandemic. However, the number of confirmed cases in viral tests is only a biased probe of this number. A general method of predicting the actual number of infections from the measured variables, such as the total tests, confirmed cases, hospitalizations and fatalities, is unavailable. In the article (https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.22.20137208v1), we achieve this by developing a model that motivates a method of data analyses of these variables. By comparing with the historical data of the USA in the past few months, we find a simple formula relating these four variables. Among a few applications, we show how the model can be used to predict the number of actual infections and the optimal test volume. This repository is to provide the data and code we have used for our analysis.
